# Changelog

All notable changes to `ichava/icon-browser` follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Inertia.js frontend serving the React 19 UI, beside the untouched JSON API.**
  `GET /{prefix}/icons` renders `Browser/Index` with the filtered listing from core's
  `IconBrowserService`; shared props (`auth`, `flash`, `preferences`, `ichava`) flow
  from the `HandleInertiaRequests` middleware through the `ichava.inertia` middleware
  group. Requires `inertiajs/inertia-laravel: ^3.3` and `@inertiajs/react: ^3.0`. Routes
  load only when `ichava.icon-browser.inertia.enabled` is truthy (on by default,
  `ICHAVA_INERTIA_ENABLED`).
- **Page controllers, one per resource, mirroring the JSON API.** Browser
  listing/detail/stats plus package, favorite, collection, history,
  command-history, settings and cache pages; mutations redirect back with flash
  data. Destructive cache routes keep the fail-closed `ichava.cache-admin` gate.
- **Canonical URLs serve Inertia pages.** The legacy Vue mount points could not stay
  mounted beside their replacements, so `routes/web.php` keeps only the `/`
  redirect; the Vue surface remains on disk, unreachable, until it is removed.
- **React component library lives under `resources/js/`.** Engine, components, hooks,
  store and tests moved in from `@ichava/react-browser` (imports via `@js`), with the
  REST transport deleted in favor of Inertia props. Requires `zustand`,
  `@tanstack/react-virtual`, `react-aria`, `@ichava/motion` and the Untitled UI packages.
- **Two-way filter sync and server mutations.** Listing state syncs with the server
  query string; all library writes (favorites, collections, history, settings,
  cache) go through the server with flash and validation feedback, and settings is
  a real form.
- **Test coverage.** `assertInertia` tests per controller; the moved JS tests run in
  this package's vitest with the `@testing-library` stack; the harness uses file
  sessions so session-backed flows persist across requests in a test.
- **Vue SPA and parallel-run React removed.** The Vue single-page app, the
  standalone React entry with its `?ui=react` flag, the legacy Blade views and
  controllers, and the checked-in Vue bundles are gone; the JSON API is untouched.
  The npm tree drops the Vue ecosystem and resolves a single `@` alias to
  `resources/js/`.
- **REST API off by default, still shipped.** The JSON routes mount only when
  `ichava.icon-browser.api.enabled` is truthy (`ICHAVA_API_ENABLED`); hosts with
  programmatic consumers opt in, everyone else serves Inertia pages alone.
- **Docs describe the React browser.** README and guides no longer reference Vue
  or the shadcn installer.

### Changed

- **`inject-scripts` speaks through translations and the shared status vocabulary.** Its four
  messages resolve from `resources/lang/en/commands.php` under `ichava/icon-browser::commands.*`,
  and render through laranail/console's `StatusLine`, so the glyphs and colours match every other
  ichava command. Injected script names are escaped before they are printed.
- `InjectNpmScriptsCommandTest` covers injecting, the already-present re-run and the missing-file
  failure. It also guards against English literals in the command and checks that every key it
  references resolves.
- **`composer.json` lists `laranail/db-tools` as a VCS repository.** `ichava/core` is about to
  require it, and Composer reads `repositories` from the root package only, so a
  consumer that does not declare it cannot resolve core at all. The entry is harmless
  until then. Nothing here is on Packagist.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-26

### Changed

- **`SECURITY.md` removed; the organization policy serves this repository now.**
  The file was byte-identical across six ichava repositories and held nothing
  specific to any of them. It was promoted into `ichava/.github` first, so the
  policy improved before any copy was removed rather than after, and GitHub
  serves that default on `/security/policy` for every repository without its
  own. The two channels and the 48-hour acknowledgement are unchanged.

- **The README's security link moved with it.** A relative
  `[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)` is a path into this repository's file tree, and
  the cascade does not put a file there -- it answers the policy page and
  nothing else. Left alone the link would have become a 404 the moment the file
  went, so it now points at `/security/policy` directly. `composer.json` and the
  issue-template link already did.

### Fixed

- **The category tree no longer blanks `/ichava/icons`.** The Inertia `tree` prop
  is `{id, title, icon_count, children}` from core's `buildIconTree()`, but the
  client tree is `{pack, label, count, cats}` and `CategoryTree` read
  `g.cats.filter` off the raw prop -- `undefined.filter`, and the page threw.
  `toCategoryGroups()` now normalises either shape (and garbage, to `[]`, so
  future backend drift cannot blank the page again) before it reaches the store.

- **Icons render again with the REST API off.** The API is now opt-in, so
  `svg_url` is null and `SvgFidelity` fell back to `assetUrl('')`, which is
  `/` -- the mask fetched the page itself and tiles came out blank. It paints
  from a data URI built out of the `svg_content` the Inertia props already
  carry, and returns `''` rather than `/` when there is neither, so an icon
  missing both assets renders nothing instead of recursing. `assetUrl()` also
  no longer prefixes an empty string with the base path.

- **A fresh install with `APP_DEBUG=true` no longer renders a blank page.**
  `vite_dev_mode` defaulted to true, and the root template loaded the Inertia
  entry from `localhost:5174` whether or not a dev server was listening --
  point the browser at a port that answers nothing. The flag is now off by
  default (`ICHAVA_VITE_DEV=true` opts in), and the template additionally probes
  the host and port for 200ms before committing to the dev server, falling back
  to the published bundle otherwise. The port is cast to `int`, so a string env
  value no longer produces `localhost:5174` with a trailing notice.

- **`HandleInertiaRequests` honours a configured root view.** It hardcoded the
  parent `rootView`, ignoring `ichava.icon-browser.inertia.root_view`, so a host
  that set the key got their template silently ignored. It now returns the
  configured view when set and falls back to the parent's otherwise.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- **`ConfigKeyResolutionTest` asserts the shipped config actually merges at
  `ichava.icon-browser`**, and that the doubled key V39 produces does not exist. Nothing
  asserted this before, which is why V39 shipped: a test calling `config()->set()` writes the
  key it then reads, so only the shipped *file* resolving proves the merge.

### Changed

- **Renamed: `ichava/browser` is now `ichava/icon-browser`.** The repository, the composer
  package, the npm package and the PHP namespace all move together, so `local dir = GitHub
  repo = composer name` continues to hold. **This is a breaking change and no version number
  expresses it** -- a consumer has to change the name it requires.

  | Surface | Before | After |
  |---|---|---|
  | composer / GitHub | `ichava/browser` | `ichava/icon-browser` |
  | npm | `@ichava/browser` | `@ichava/icon-browser` |
  | PSR-4 root | `Simtabi\Laranail\Ichava\Browser\` | `…\Ichava\IconBrowser\` |
  | provider | `IchavaBrowserServiceProvider` | `IconBrowserServiceProvider` |
  | config file | `config/browser.php` | `config/icon-browser.php` |
  | config key | `ichava.browser.*` | `ichava.icon-browser.*` |
  | view namespace | `ichava/browser` | `ichava/icon-browser` |
  | Blade alias | `ichava-browser` | `ichava-icon-browser` |
  | Artisan | `ichava::browser.inject-scripts` | `ichava::icon-browser.inject-scripts` |
  | publish tags | `--tag=ichava::browser-*` | `--tag=ichava::icon-browser-*` |

  **If you published this package's views**, the override directory moves from
  `resources/views/vendor/ichava/browser/` to `resources/views/vendor/ichava/icon-browser/`.

  **Four surfaces deliberately did not move**, because each names something other than the
  package and each fails silently if renamed:

  - **Route names.** `route('ichava.browser')` and its 13 call sites stay, along with the
    `ichava.api.*` family. These are an `ichava.*` namespace naming *features*, not the
    package; renaming one of them and not the others would be inconsistent as well as
    breaking. Same reasoning that defers `<x-ichava::icon>` to 1.0.
  - **The `ichava.browser()` JavaScript API**, 18 call sites, which is this package's public
    JS surface.
  - **`ICHAVA_BROWSER_PREFIX`, `_RATE_LIMIT`, `_PER_PAGE`, `_CACHE`.** A renamed environment
    variable reads as unset and the default applies with nothing reported -- the quietest
    failure available -- and renaming buys nothing.
  - **Historical CHANGELOG entries.** Past entries describe what shipped at the time; only
    the repository URLs were updated. Rewriting them would make this file lie about its own
    history.

- **The markdown path filter now matches markdown at any depth.**
  `code-quality.yml` and `tests.yml` carried `paths-ignore: '*.md'`. In GitHub's
  filter syntax a single `*` does not cross a `/`, so that pattern matched a
  root-level `README.md` and nothing else -- every edit under `docs/` ran the
  full PHP suite and the static-analysis job, which is precisely what the filter
  existed to skip. `'**.md'` matches at any depth.

  Worth stating which direction this failed in, because it decides how urgent it
  was: a broken `paths-ignore` runs **more** than it should, never less. The cost
  was CI minutes on a free-plan allowance, not a gate that stopped firing.

- **Dead links to the deleted `ichava/documentation` repository removed.** That repository no
  longer exists, so every cross-reference to it resolved to a 404. The reporting channels in
  `SECURITY.md` were already stated inline and are unchanged; the Code of Conduct now cites the
  Contributor Covenant directly. Historical mentions in this changelog are left as written.

### Fixed

- **Per-route rate limits were silently ignored.** `Helpers::getRateLimit()` read its master
  switch from the correct key but the actual limit from `config("ichava-browser.rate_limiting.
  {$type}")` -- the pre-V39 key form, which has never resolved -- so every call fell through to
  the hardcoded `$default` and the configured `rate_limiting` block did nothing. Found by the
  rename sweep rather than by a test, because the fallback made the wrong value look right.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-21

### Changed

- **`ichava/core` `^0.4` is accepted.** The constraint read
  `^0.2.8 || ^0.3.1`, and a caret on a `0.x` version pins the *minor*, so
  `0.4.0` did not satisfy it at all. An application that wanted core `0.4`
  could not install this package beside it, and Composer reported that as a
  conflict on `ichava/core` rather than on the package holding it back.

  The branch is **added, not substituted**. `^0.2.8` and `^0.3.1` keep
  resolving, because nothing here calls an API that `0.4` introduced -- the
  suite is green on both `v0.3.1` and `v0.4.0` -- so widening is the whole
  change and raising the floor would strand consumers for no gain.

- **The view namespace is now `ichava/browser`, not the bare `ichava`.**
  `hasViews()` was being passed an explicit `'ichava'`, overriding the
  vendor-scoped default that `hasTranslations()` in the same provider already
  took. Laravel keeps view namespaces in a flat hint map, so a bare generic slug
  is a key any sibling package, third-party package or the consuming application
  could also claim -- and the second claimant replaces the first with **no
  error**, surfacing much later as a missing view.

  Seven internal `view('ichava::...')` call sites moved with it. None was
  documented as public API.

  Registering the vendor-scoped name also makes package-tools add the tag-safe
  alias `ichava-browser` over the same paths, because Blade's component-tag
  pattern admits no forward slash. Both spellings resolve the same files.

  **If you published this package's views, your overrides will stop being
  found.** The directory moves from `resources/views/vendor/ichava/` to
  `resources/views/vendor/ichava/browser/`. Move it, or re-publish with
  `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=ichava::browser-views`. Nothing errors if
  you do neither -- the package's own templates simply render instead of yours.
  The publish tag is derived from the package name and is unchanged.

  `<x-ichava::icon>` and every other `<x-ichava::...>` tag are **unaffected**.
  Those are Blade component registries, not the view-hint map; renaming them is
  a separate, deferred decision recorded in the provider alongside the
  registration.

- **`branch-alias` moves to `0.3.x-dev`, because `0.3.0` starts a series.** It
  read `0.2.x-dev` while this release opens the 0.3 line, and a path or VCS
  consumer tracking `dev-main` takes that alias as the version -- so a `^0.3`
  constraint would not have matched the branch it points at. Tagged installs
  were never affected, which is why nothing surfaced it.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- **Package titles and descriptions were read under a key nothing ever wrote.**
  Seven call sites read `$packageData['browser_metadata'][...]`. `IconRegistry`
  has never written that key -- 16 reads across `ichava/core` and this package,
  **zero writes** -- so every one fell through its `??` default. The SPA showed
  the package slug where a title belonged and an empty string where a
  description belonged.

  Nothing failed, because each fallback looked plausible. A fallback is only a
  safety net if something notices you are standing in it. The values were there
  the whole time, one level up.

- **A missing shared Vite generator now says so.** `vite.config.js` imports
  `ViteConfigGenerator` from `<workspace>/.scripts/vite/vite-configurator.js`,
  which lives outside every repository by design. A bare `import` of a path that
  is not there fails with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` naming a resolved absolute
  path, which reads like a broken install rather than a workspace this package
  was never checked out into.

  Since the file is outside every repo, its absence is the *normal* case for
  anyone who cloned this package on its own -- a contributor, CI, a consumer
  rebuilding assets. The config now checks for it first and explains what is
  missing, where it was expected, and that prebuilt assets are committed under
  `public/assets` so no build is needed to use the package.

  **Deliberately not falling back to a locally-reconstructed config.** The
  generator owns asset naming and the CSS-only-entry stub; a fallback producing
  subtly different output than the committed assets would be worse than one that
  refuses, because the build would succeed and ship the wrong files.

  > The import depth itself was corrected separately in #22 -- four levels up
  > from `packages/browser` reaches the workspace root, three did before the
  > restructure. That fix is right; this is about what happens when the file at
  > that path does not exist.

- **`public/assets/js/ichava-react.js` was 18 days stale and shipped five package names that no
  longer exist.** It is build output, checked in, last built 2026-09-03 — before the react
  sources moved to the `icon-sets-` names on 2026-09-21. Rebuilt rather than edited; the
  `ichava-react.css` beside it was stale for the same reason and moved with it.

### Security

- **The package endpoint no longer risks publishing filesystem paths.** One of
  those reads passed the whole array through as
  `'metadata' => $packageData['browser_metadata'] ?? []`, which returned an
  empty array for its entire life. Repointing it at the real metadata without
  filtering would have started serving `base_path` and `provider_class` --
  absolute paths and internal class names -- from an endpoint anyone who can
  reach the browser can call.

  It now goes through an **allow-list**, not a blocklist, so a key the registry
  grows later is withheld until someone chooses to publish it. A test adds an
  unknown key and asserts it does not escape.

  > Not an exploitable regression in any released version: the key never
  > existed, so the response was always empty. It would have become one in this
  > change.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-09-21

### Changed

- **`ichava/core` floor raised to `^0.2.8 || ^0.3.1`.** The `labels` payload
  below arrives from core and was written to degrade to an absent key, so this
  is not a correctness fix -- it is the difference between localised taxonomy
  labels being guaranteed and being best-effort. `0.3.1` is the first core
  release that carries them.

  The `^0.2.8` arm is kept deliberately. Dropping it to require `^0.3.1` alone
  would cut off the 0.2 line for no benefit; raising the floor of the 0.3 arm
  excludes the releases without `labels` and nothing else.

### Added

- **Localised taxonomy labels in the package payloads.** `labels` carries a
  pack's `variants` / `categories` / `sets` display names, which `config.json`
  has no equivalent for, and follows the application locale because
  `ichava/core` applies its translation overlay on read.

  Degrades cleanly: against a core that does not supply `labels`, the key is
  simply absent. The composer floor is unchanged for that reason -- it moves
  when core next tags a release carrying the overlay.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- **`actionlint` runs on every pull request.** Nothing validated the workflow files at all:
  `release.yml` triggers only on `push: tags`, so a broken workflow was first observed as a
  release that refused to start — after the decision to release had been made.

  A YAML parse is not a substitute, and that is the sharp part. `yaml.safe_load` accepts a
  duplicate key and silently keeps the last one, so a double-applied patch that left
  `continue-on-error:` twice on a single step validated clean and would have failed only at tag
  time. `actionlint` rejects what Actions rejects.

  Checked against the defect rather than assumed: injecting that duplicate key, a typo'd step
  key, and an `if:` referencing a property that does not exist are all caught, while
  `yaml.safe_load` still parses the first of them without complaint.

### Fixed

- **A failed SBOM download no longer takes the whole release down.** `release.yml` generates the
  SBOM before it publishes, and the Syft installer fetches its checksums from GitHub's
  release-asset CDN. On 2026-09-21 that answered `504` for about twenty minutes, failing the job
  four times *before* the publish step — so the tag existed with no release behind it, which is
  the drift the release table exists to catch, produced by the release machinery itself.

  Two changes. The step now retries once after 45 seconds, which covers a single transient `504`
  — the common case. And a second failure no longer fails the job: the release publishes without
  the asset and emits a `::warning::` naming the re-run.

  **The two failure states are not equally bad, and that asymmetry is the whole design.** A
  release missing an attachment is repaired by re-running this workflow, which re-attaches it. A
  tag with no release persists silently until a person notices. Preferring the recoverable one
  is worth the loss of "every release always carries an SBOM" as an absolute.

  `fail_on_unmatched_files: false` is now stated on the publish step. It is already the action's
  default, but the point of this change is that a missing SBOM must not fail the publish, so it
  should not rest on a default a future reader has to know.

### Security

- **Floor raised to `ichava/core: ^0.2.8`.** Core `0.2.8` fixes two issues a pack inherits
  through the engine: `%` and `_` in a search query acted as `LIKE` wildcards, widening results
  and forcing full-table scans; and the icon watcher followed symlinks and read files of
  unbounded size, so a link inside a watched directory pointed the reader anywhere on disk.

  `^0.2.5` still permitted resolving to `0.2.5`, `0.2.6` or `0.2.7`, all of which carry both.
  The `|| ^0.3` arm is unchanged — core `0.3.0` moved the scaffolder out but left the engine,
  registry, seeder and SVG pipeline untouched, so an installed pack is unaffected by it.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-09-21

### Changed

- **`ichava/core` widened to `^0.2.5 || ^0.3`.** Core `0.3.0` removes the icon-package
  scaffolder and its stub tree, which moved to `ichava/icon-package-scaffolder`. This package
  never used either, so it works unchanged on both series.

  Widened rather than raised on purpose. A caret on a `0.x` version pins the minor, so plain
  `^0.2.5` cannot resolve `0.3.0` and this package would have held every consumer back on the
  0.2 series for a removal that does not affect it. Raising it to `^0.3` instead would have
  forced a core upgrade on anyone deliberately staying on 0.2.x, for the same non-reason.
  Both series genuinely work, so the constraint says so.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-09-21

### Security

- **Floor raised to `ichava/core: ^0.2.5`.** Core `0.2.5` closes an address-notation gap in the
  pack update-check guard: `isPublicIp()` judged addresses by how they were written, so
  `::7f00:1` and `::a9fe:a9fe` — IPv4-compatible IPv6 spellings of `127.0.0.1` and of the
  `169.254.169.254` cloud-metadata address — were accepted while the same addresses in dotted
  form were refused. `^0.2.4` still permitted resolving to `0.2.4`, which has it.

  Weaker than the containment fixes in `0.2.4`: the notation was deprecated in 2006 and most
  stacks will not route it. The floor moves anyway, because a constraint that can resolve to a
  release with a known gap is the thing this rule exists to prevent.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-09-21

### Security

- **Floor raised to `ichava/core: ^0.2.4`.** Core `0.2.4` carries seven security fixes — post-
  sanitizer attribute gating, icon-path containment, off-document paint URLs, sanitizer policy
  flag enforcement, SVG driver containment, debug path leakage and pack update-check URL
  restriction. `^0.2.3` still permitted resolving to `0.2.3`, which has all seven. Raising a
  floor to exclude a known-broken release is not a pin; the constraint stays a range.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- **Requires `ichava/core: ^0.2.3`.** `0.2.2` decided readiness against columns the schema has
  never had, so `ichava::ichava-core.info status` reported `UNINITIALIZED` on a fully seeded
  database and both auto-seed listeners, which gate on the same check, never fired. The floor is
  raised rather than the range widened; it still tracks every `0.2.x` from `0.2.3` on.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- **Requires `ichava/core: ^0.2.2`.** The floor is raised rather than the range widened: `0.2.0`
  invoked six of its own Artisan commands by names it had just retired, and `0.2.1` still passed
  `migrate` a `--path` that resolved nowhere, so `database migrate` reported success and created
  no tables. `^0.2` admitted both. Raising a floor to exclude a known-broken release is not a
  pin — the range still tracks every `0.2.x` from `0.2.2` on.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-16


### Breaking

- **Requires `ichava/core: ^0.2`.** Core `0.2.0` moved its config key to `ichava.ichava-core.*`
  and renamed every Artisan command with no bare aliases, so a host application upgrading this
  package has to upgrade core with it.
- **`ichava:inject-scripts` is now `ichava::browser.inject-scripts`, and the bare name is gone.**
  Artisan's command table is a flat map keyed by name, so a bare slug is a key any sibling
  package could also claim, and the second claimant replaces the first silently. It is not
  retained as an alias: an alias that reintroduces the bare name hands back the same collision.


### Fixed

- Four `config('ichava.core.*')` reads left orphaned by core's config rename — CORS, request
  logging, auth debug and the route prefix were silently returning defaults.
- Icon components called non-existent `::getName()`; now use `::getPackageName()`.
- Facade imports (`DB`) made explicit in both controllers.

### Changed

- Third-party GitHub Actions pinned to the commit SHA of their latest release; `actions/*` keep
  floating on a major tag. A tag is mutable, so `@v4` is a promise the action's owner can
  rewrite; pinning GitHub's own actions inside GitHub's own runner buys nothing.
- The test harness reads `DB_CONNECTION`, so the suite targets SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL or
  MariaDB. SQLite runs enable `foreign_key_constraints`, which Laravel applies only when the key
  is present.
- Hardened CI workflows: concurrency groups, job timeouts, problem matchers, docs-only skip paths, test coverage, and tidy composer scripts.
- Aligned Pest to `^4.6 || ^5.0` and CI branch triggers on `main` only.

### Added

- `release.yml` — a `v*.*.*` tag now publishes a release whose body is that version's CHANGELOG
  section, and fails closed when the tagged version has no section.
- The database matrix: CI runs the suite against PostgreSQL 17, MySQL 8.4 and MariaDB 11.4 as
  service containers alongside the SQLite lane. These API tests refresh real tables and query
  through core's models, so SQLite alone proved nothing about the other three.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- **`IchavaApiSecurity` no longer overwrites headers a route set deliberately.** It ran after
  the controller and unconditionally `set()` every header, so the SVG endpoint's `immutable`
  cache header and its tight `sandbox` CSP never reached a client and every icon was served
  `no-store`. Routes now declare ownership through `IchavaApiSecurity::claimHeaders()`, limited
  to an `OVERRIDABLE_HEADERS` allow-list -- a route cannot opt out of `nosniff`,
  `X-Frame-Options`, CORS or HSTS. A plain `has()` check could not implement this: Symfony
  synthesises `Cache-Control: no-cache, private` on every response, so a `has()`-gated
  middleware would have silently stopped sending `no-store` on the JSON API.
- **The frontend test environment no longer hides sanitiser failures.** Under happy-dom
  (tested at 15 and 20) DOMPurify strips every element -- `sanitize('<b>hi</b>')` returns
  `hi` -- so the sanitiser suite passed by returning nothing and every "strips X" assertion
  was true for the wrong reason. Switched to jsdom, and added an assertion that checks
  removal and survival of the same input, which fails both for an empty return and for a
  passthrough.
- **The client SVG sanitiser fails closed.** It returned its raw input when DOMPurify was
  unavailable, emitting unsanitised markup exactly when it could not sanitise. It now returns
  an empty string.

### Changed

- **Client SVG sanitisation derives from the shared policy.** The allow-lists were literals
  in `sanitizeSvg.ts`, which is how this runtime and the server drifted apart: `W1-6` widened
  the server and nothing widened the client, and a census then measured 3,507 icons rendering
  correctly on the Blade path and wrong in the SPA -- metronic worst at 266 of 501. Both now
  read `security/svg-policy.json`.
- **`SanitizeOptions.allowStyle` removed.** It had no callers and had stopped doing anything:
  the policy lists the `style` element in `forbiddenTags`, and DOMPurify's `FORBID_TAGS` wins
  over `ALLOWED_TAGS`, so it could only ever have appeared to work. The style *attribute* is
  separate and is allowed.
- **The SVG URL is content-addressed.** `IconResource::svg_url` publishes
  `?v=<render_version>`, and the endpoint serves `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` only
  when the request carries the current token; anything else gets
  `public, max-age=300, must-revalidate` with the same ETag. Callers on the bare id URL keep
  working and receive current bytes -- they simply do not get a year of immutability on a URL
  that cannot express which year. Requires `ichava/core` 0.1.1 for `Icon::render_version`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-31

First open-source release. The entire HTTP layer of the Ichava icon ecosystem: REST API, web
routes, middleware, Blade views and the Vue + Vite browser SPA. `ichava/core` ships no HTTP
surface, so this package is what turns the headless engine into a browsable icon library.

Earlier `v1.0.0` and `v2.0.0` tags existed on GitHub and were never published to Packagist. They
are withdrawn: the ecosystem restarts from a single `0.1.0` across every package.

### Added

- REST API over the icon catalogue: listing, filtering, search, per-package detail, stats, raw SVG
  delivery, and `GET /api/icons/update-status`, which surfaces core's `IconPackUpdateChecker` for
  dashboards. Response shape mirrors `ichava:check-icon-updates --format=json`.
- Vue 3 + Vite single-page browser with Blade views and layout components.
- `HostCapabilities`, which adapts the middleware stack to whatever the host app provides, 
  Sanctum plus sessions, sessions only, or a stateless host: rather than assuming one shape.
- `SriAsset` Blade component resolving subresource-integrity hashes from a Vite manifest or from
  disk.
- A configurable security layer: CSP with `strict`/`nonce`/`hash` modes, HSTS, frame, referrer and
  permissions policies, CORS, and per-route rate limits.

### Security

- **Destructive cache endpoints require authorization and fail closed.** `POST
  ichava/api/cache/clear`, `POST ichava/api/cache/rebuild` and their web equivalents shipped with
  a rate limit and no authorization, so any caller who could reach the API could flush the icon
  cache. `rebuildCache()` also calls `PreferenceService::clear()`, so one unauthenticated request
  wiped every stored preference. Grant access with:

  ```php
  Gate::define('ichava.manage-cache', fn ($user) => $user->isAdmin());
  ```

  The ability is configurable at `ichava.browser.security.cache_admin.ability`. A trusted internal
  deployment can set `…cache_admin.allow_without_gate` to `true`; it is off by default.
- CORS defaults to `APP_URL` rather than `*`. Set `ICHAVA_API_CORS_ORIGINS=*` explicitly if you
  need the wildcard.
- `svg()` sanitises the icon name before emitting it in `Content-Disposition`; a name carrying a
  quote, newline or semicolon could previously break out of the header value.
- Request PII (IP, user agent) demoted from `info` to `debug`, and removed entirely from
  cache-mutation logs. The audit channel is the right home for it.
- Exception detail no longer reaches the rendered view. The full exception with trace still goes
  to the log.

### Fixed

- **The package config now loads at the key the source reads.** The file was
  `config/ichava-browser.php` while the package short name is `browser`, so it merged at
  `ichava.browser.ichava-browser.*` while all 27 read sites used `config('ichava-browser.*')`.
  Every one returned `null`, which left the CSP, HSTS, frame and referrer policies, the rate
  limits, `max_request_size` and the CORS origins inert, the CORS default above included. The
  file is now `config/browser.php` and the key is `ichava.browser`.
- `stats()` no longer fires three queries per registered package. Two batched `GROUP BY` queries
  fetch all icon and term counts, reassembled in PHP.
- The stats view no longer crashes on a missing count key or on a cache statistic that comes back
  as a nested array.
- The npm package is `@ichava/browser`. It was `@tusente/ichava`, a scope belonging to an
  unrelated product, while the sibling React package is `@ichava/react-browser`.
- `dompurify` floor raised to `^3.4.14`; everything at or below `3.4.12` carries an XSS advisory
  where removing an `IN_PLACE` hook leaves a detached subtree executable.

### Requirements

- PHP `^8.4.1 || ^8.5`, `illuminate/support` `^13.0`, `ichava/core` `^0.1`.
- Neither `ichava/*` nor `laranail/*` is published on Packagist, so the package declares VCS
  repository entries for core and the three laranail dependencies.
