> The HTTP layer for the Ichava Laravel icon ecosystem — REST API, React 19 + Inertia.js browser pages and middleware, installed on top of `ichava/core` when you want a visual icon browser or programmatic REST access.

This package is not published to Packagist, so there is no registry-version badge to show. Targets PHP `^8.4.1 || ^8.5` on Laravel `^13`, against `ichava/core` `^0.2.8 || ^0.3.1`.

## Install

```bash
composer require ichava/icon-browser
```

Browser and its dependencies are unpublished, so your application's `composer.json` needs VCS repository entries before that command resolves — [Installation](docs/installation.md) gives the block, then covers publishing the config and SPA assets and reaching the browser at `/{prefix}/icons`.
